# Stage 1: Build the Application
# We use node:22 as the base for building and installing dependencies.
FROM node:22 AS build

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json first to leverage Docker caching.
# If these files don't change, subsequent builds can skip 'npm install'.
COPY package*.json ./
COPY tsconfig.json ./

# Install dependencies including TypeScript
RUN npm install
RUN npm install --save-dev typescript @types/node

# Copy the rest of the application source code
COPY . .

# Build TypeScript
RUN npm run build || npx tsc

# Stage 2: Create the Final Production Image
# We use node:22-slim as a minimal runtime image.
FROM node:22-slim

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy only production dependencies
COPY --from=build /usr/src/app/package*.json ./
RUN npm install --only=production

# Copy the built application files from the 'build' stage
COPY --from=build /usr/src/app/dist ./dist

# Expose the port your app runs on
ENV PORT=8080
EXPOSE $PORT

# Run the application using the non-root user (recommended for security)
USER node

# Define the command to start your application
CMD [ "node", "dist/index.js" ]
